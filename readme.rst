Machine Learning Models
=======================

1. Decision Tree based models
------------------------------------------

| The implementation is based on **C&RT algorithm** without pruning and uses the **Gini index** as the impurity measure.
|
| Python packages **numpy** is required.
| 
| 1.1. Decision Tree
| 1.2. Decision Stump
| 1.3. Random Forest (consists of multiple decision trees)
| 1.4. Random Stump Forest (consists of multiple decision stumps)
|
| * Usage
|
| Simply import the class into your implementation.
| Take **Random Forest** Model for instance:

::

    from randomForest import randomForest
